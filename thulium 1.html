            Meet thulium, a silvery metal with the symbol Tm and atomic number
            69. It's part of the lanthanide group, known as the "rare earth
            elements," and ranks as the thirteenth rarest on Earth. Despite its
            name, thulium is actually more abundant than elements like silver
            and iodine! Like other lanthanides, it's soft and malleable, and its
            most common form (Î²-Tm) has a hexagonal crystal structure.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            This interesting element exhibits some unique magnetic behaviors.
            Below freezing temperatures, it becomes ferromagnetic, acting like a
            miniature magnet. When it warms up a bit, it switches to
            antiferromagnetism, where its tiny magnetic domains point in
            opposite directions. Above room temperature, it changes again,
            becoming paramagnetic and susceptible to external magnetic fields.
            Thulium also has two main isotopes, one of which can be used to
            create portable X-ray machines for medical applications.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            While not as widely used as some other lanthanides, thulium finds
            its niche in specialized areas. Its specific wavelengths make it
            useful in certain types of lasers, like those used in eye surgery.
            It's also being explored for applications in solid-state memory and
            fuel cells. Though not currently known to have biological roles,
            thulium research continues to expand our understanding of this
            fascinating element and its potential uses in the future.

          Thulium, element number 69, wears many hats. It's a silvery metal
          belonging to the "rare earth" lanthanide family, yet more abundant
          than some "common" elements. It shifts personalities depending on
          temperature, acting as a tiny magnet, then an antiferromagnet, and
          finally becoming open to external magnetism. While not essential for
          life, it finds its spotlight in specialized lasers for delicate
          surgeries and holds promise for future technologies like memory and

          In 1879, Per Teodor Cleve, a Swedish chemist, embarked on a quest to
          purify erbium. Little did he know, his journey would lead him to
          discover not one, but two new elements! Cleve meticulously removed
          known contaminants, revealing a green oxide he named "thulia," after
          the ancient name for Scandinavia. This oxide held the key to thulium's
          existence.

              Its unique spectral signature hinted at the unseen element within.
              It wasn't until later that Charles James, working in the US,

              Early misconceptions led Cleve to slightly misspell the element as
              "thulium" instead of "thule," but the name stuck. Understanding
              thulium's unique magnetic behaviors and specific wavelengths
              opened doors to specialized applications. Today, thulium shines in

          Thulium, the rare earth element with surprising versatility, doesn't
          exist as a free metal in nature. Instead, it hides within other
          minerals, waiting to be unveiled. The primary source is monazite, a

          monazite is minuscule, around 0.007%, requiring specialized techniques
          like ion exchange and solvent extraction to separate it from its
