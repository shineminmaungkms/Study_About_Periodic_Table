            Samarium (Sm), number 62 on the periodic table, is a moderately
            hard, silvery metal belonging to the lanthanide group. Think soft
            zinc-like with a beautiful shine when freshly cut. While stable in
            air, it slowly tarnishes, eventually turning dull. Don't worry about
            catching fire though, it only bursts into flames at high
            temperatures.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Discovered in 1879 from the mineral samarskite (named after a
            Russian official!), samarium wasn't truly isolated until years
            later. Today, it's found in various minerals and used in several
            ways. Its biggest claim to fame? Super strong permanent magnets!
            Samarium also helps create special glass and ceramics for unique
            applications.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite the "rare earth" label, samarium isn't actually that rare in
            Earth's crust. However, extracting it can be tricky. Luckily, its
            unique properties make it worth the effort. From high-tech
            electronics to medical lasers, samarium plays a hidden role in many
            modern technologies.

          Samarium, element number 62, is a soft, silvery metal found alongside
          its fellow lanthanides. Though named after a mineral, it wasn't truly
          isolated until 1879. Stable in air but prone to tarnishing, it shines
          brightly when freshly cut but ignites only at high temperatures.
          Extracted from various minerals, its claim to fame lies in
          super-strong permanent magnets and specialized glass and ceramics.
          While not truly "rare," its unique properties make it a valuable
          player in modern technology.

          he story begins in 1853, when Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de
          Marignac noticed distinct spectral lines in a material called
          "didymium." These lines hinted at a hidden element, but it took almost
          30 years to unveil it.

          Samarium packs a punch in various ways. One key role is in
          high-performance magnets: the heat-resistant samarium-cobalt variety
          fuels your headphones, guitar pickups, and even helps guide missiles
          with precision. Additionally, a different isotope acts as a shield in
          nuclear reactors, absorbing neutrons to ensure safety and control. And
          the fight against cancer gets a boost from another isotope, targeting
          and destroying malignant cells in various forms. So, while you might
          not see samarium shining bright, its hidden applications impact your
