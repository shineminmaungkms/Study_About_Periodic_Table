            scandium (Sc), chemical element, a rare-earth metal of Group 3 of
            the periodic table. Scandium is a silvery white, moderately soft
            metal. It is fairly stable in air but will slowly change its colour
            from silvery white to a yellowish appearance because of formation of
            Sc2O3 oxide on the surface.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Scandium is mainly used for research purposes. It has, however,
            great potential because it has almost as low a density as aluminium
            and a much higher melting point. An aluminium-scandium alloy has
            been used in Russian MIG fighter planes, high-end bicycle frames and
            baseball bats.

          Scandium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sc and atomic number 21.
          It is a silvery-white metallic d-block element. Historically, it has

          lanthanides.

          Scandium, a silvery-white metal with surprising strength and
          lightness, boasts a history intertwined with both chance and
          scientific deduction. Its story begins in the late 19th century with
          the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson. While meticulously working
          with rare-earth minerals, Nilson stumbled upon an unknown element
          hidden within. Through careful analysis, he identified its unique
          spectral signature, marking the official discovery of scandium in
          1879.

            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              Intriguingly, the existence of scandium wasn't entirely a
              surprise. Just a decade earlier, the visionary chemist Dmitri
              Mendeleev, guided by the periodic table's predictive power, had
              postulated the existence of an element with properties eerily
              similar to scandium. He even dubbed it "eka-boron," meaning "below
              boron" in its place on the table. When Nilson's discovery came to
              light, the scientific community marveled at the remarkable
              alignment between prediction and reality, cementing the power of
              the periodic table as a roadmap for exploring the unseen.

          Scandium, a silver-white metallic element, might be rare, but it pops
          up in surprising places! It's found in trace amounts in many minerals,
          but commercially, it's usually extracted as a byproduct from mining
          other metals like titanium and uranium. While Madagascar and
          Scandinavia boast rare minerals with concentrated scandium,
          thortveitite being the champion, most comes from reprocessing waste
          materials from other mining operations.

          Scandium, a silvery-white metal, boasts several unique properties that
          set it apart. It's remarkably lightweight, yet exceptionally strong,
          making it an attractive candidate for high-performance alloys used in
          airplanes and even baseball bats. Scandium also readily conducts
          electricity and heat, making it useful in some types of lighting and
          potential future applications like fuel cells. But perhaps its most
          interesting property is its rarity. Despite being the 23rd most
          abundant element in Earth's crust, it's scattered in trace amounts,
          making its extraction a fascinating scientific and engineering
          challenge.
