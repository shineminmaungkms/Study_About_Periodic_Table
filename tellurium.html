          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Tellurium, with the symbol Te and atomic number 52, is a rare,
            brittle, and mildly toxic metalloid. It shares similarities with
            elements like sulfur and selenium, belonging to the chalcogen group
            in the periodic table. While uncommon on Earth, tellurium is
            surprisingly abundant in the universe. However, its volatile nature
            during Earth's formation likely caused it to escape into space,
            leading to its scarcity on our planet.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Tellurium exhibits a unique duality, possessing properties of both
            metals and non-metals. It appears as a silvery-white solid, often
            found in crystalline form. Interestingly, tellurium is a
            semiconductor, meaning its electrical conductivity can be
            manipulated by adding impurities (doping). This property makes it
            valuable in various applications, including solar cells and
            rewritable CDs and DVDs.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its rarity, tellurium finds use in several crucial
            industries. It strengthens and improves the durability of metals
            like lead and steel when added as an alloying agent. Tellurium also
            plays a role in coloring glass and ceramics, adding a touch of
            vibrancy to everyday objects. Additionally, its semiconducting
            properties hold promise for future advancements in technology,
            making tellurium a valuable element with diverse potential.

          Tellurium's journey began in 1782, discovered by Franz Joseph Müller
          von Reichenstein in Romania. Initially mistaken for antimony, further
          investigation revealed it as a new element. However, recognition was
          delayed until 1798 when Martin Heinrich Klaproth confirmed its
          existence and named it "tellurium," after the Latin word for Earth.
          For over a century, tellurium remained a scientific curiosity. But the
          20th century saw its potential unfold, with applications emerging in
          alloys, solar cells, and electronics, solidifying its place as a
          valuable, albeit rare, element in our technological world.

          The story of tellurium starts in 1782, with Franz Joseph Müller von
          Reichenstein in Romania. Intrigued by an ore with a metallic sheen, he
          believed it to be antimony but couldn't match its properties. After
          years of research, he determined it was a new element, but his
          findings in an obscure journal went largely unnoticed.

          While tellurium exists in its native form and as telluride minerals,
          commercially, it's primarily obtained as a byproduct during the
          refining of other metals. The major source comes from anode slimes
          generated in the electrolytic refining of copper. Additionally,
          tellurium can be recovered from residues produced during the smelting
          of lead, nickel, precious metals, and zinc. Although tellurium-bearing
          minerals like calaverite and sylvanite exist, their scarcity makes
          them less significant contributors to tellurium production.
