            Titanium is a silvery-white metal with atomic number 22. It is a
            lightweight, ductile, strong, corrosion-resistant, and biocompatible
            metal with a high strength-to-weight ratio. Titanium is the 9th most
            abundant element on Earth. It is commonly found in rocks, clay, and
            sand.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            These alloys are mainly used in aircraft, spacecraft and missiles
            because of their low density and ability to withstand extremes of
            temperature. They are also used in golf clubs, laptops, bicycles and
            crutches. Power plant condensers use titanium pipes because of their
            resistance to corrosion.

          The story of titanium starts in the late 18th century, not with a
          scientist, but with a clergyman! In 1791, William Gregor, an amateur
          geologist in England, stumbled upon an unknown element while studying
          black sand. He named it "menachanite," unaware of the hidden treasure
          he held. It wasn't until almost a century later, in 1887, that German
          chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth identified and named the pure element
          "titanium" after the mythological Titans known for their strength.
          <br /><br />
          Isolating titanium, however, proved even more challenging. Early
          attempts resulted in brittle, impure forms. It wasn't until the 1930s
          and the development of the Kroll process that scientists could finally
          produce usable metallic titanium. This breakthrough paved the way for
          its modern applications.
        </p>

          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 10px">
              Titanium's properties quickly turned heads. Despite being lighter
              than steel, it boasts remarkable strength and corrosion
              resistance. This unique combination made it perfect for the
              aerospace industry, where weight reduction is crucial. From jet
              engines to airframes, titanium became a key player in aircraft
              design.
              <br /><br />
              But its applications extend far beyond the skies. In medicine,
              titanium's biocompatibility makes it ideal for prosthetics and
              implants, offering durability and integration with the human body.
              In everyday life, you might find titanium in sports equipment,
              bicycles, and even jewelry, valued for its strength, lightness,
              and aesthetic appeal.
              <br /><br />
              As research continues, the potential of titanium keeps expanding.
              From exploring its use in energy storage to delving into its
              properties at extreme temperatures, this versatile element
              continues to surprise and inspire scientists and engineers around
              the world.

          Scandium is mainly used for research purposes. It has, however, great
          potential because it has almost as low a density as aluminium and a
          much higher melting point. An aluminium-scandium alloy has been used
          in Russian MIG fighter planes, high-end bicycle frames and baseball
          bats.

        <div class="w-75 important">
          Scandium is used in aluminum-scandium alloys for aerospace industry
          components and for sports equipment such as bicycle frames, fishing
          rods, golf iron shafts and baseball bats. Scandium iodide is used in
          mercury vapor lamps, which are used to replicate sunlight in studios
          for the film and television industry.

          Scandium, a silver-white metallic element, might be rare, but it pops
          up in surprising places! It's found in trace amounts in many minerals,
          but commercially, it's usually extracted as a byproduct from mining
          other metals like titanium and uranium. While Madagascar and
          Scandinavia boast rare minerals with concentrated scandium,
          thortveitite being the champion, most comes from reprocessing waste
          materials from other mining operations.

          Scandium, a silvery-white metal, boasts several unique properties that
          set it apart. It's remarkably lightweight, yet exceptionally strong,
          making it an attractive candidate for high-performance alloys used in
          airplanes and even baseball bats. Scandium also readily conducts
          electricity and heat, making it useful in some types of lighting and
          potential future applications like fuel cells. But perhaps its most
          interesting property is its rarity. Despite being the 23rd most
          abundant element in Earth's crust, it's scattered in trace amounts,
          making its extraction a fascinating scientific and engineering
          challenge.
