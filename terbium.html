          The story of terbium begins in 1843, amidst the bustling scientific
          scene of Stockholm. Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, already
          renowned for discovering lanthanum, turned his attention to the
          mineral yttria, suspecting it harbored more secrets. Through
          meticulous chemical separations, he identified three fractions:
          yttria, erbia (pink), and terbia (yellow). However, the "terbia"
          fraction held a twist.

          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p class="text text-white p-2" style="margin-top: 60px">
              Later analysis revealed that Mosander's "terbia" actually
              contained not one, but two elements - the true terbium and its
              pink sibling, erbium. It wasn't until the 20th century, with
              advancements in ion-exchange techniques, that pure terbium was
              finally isolated. Despite the initial confusion, terbium's unique
              properties started to emerge. Scientists discovered its vibrant
              green fluorescence under ultraviolet light, leading to its use in
              early fluorescent lamps and lasers. Its exceptional specific heat
              capacity also drew attention, paving the way for its
              implementation in solid-state devices for electronics and data
              storage.
