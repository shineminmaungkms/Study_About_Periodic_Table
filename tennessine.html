            Tennessine, element number 117, sits proudly as the second heaviest
            element ever discovered. This synthetically produced marvel boasts
            an atomic mass heavier than any other element found naturally on
            Earth. Its existence pushes the boundaries of our understanding of
            atomic stability and hints at the possibility of even heavier
            elements waiting to be found.
          </p>

          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Despite its impressive weight, Tennessine is incredibly short-lived.
            All known isotopes decay within a fraction of a second, making it
            difficult to study its properties in detail. However, scientists
            believe its fleeting existence provides evidence for the theorized
            "island of stability," a region in the periodic table where
            superheavy elements might defy the trend of rapid decay.
          </p>
          <p class="text text-white p-2">
            Tennessine's name honors the state of Tennessee, a hub for research
            into transuranium elements, which are elements heavier than uranium.
            This recognition reflects the significant contributions of research
            centers like Oak Ridge National Laboratory and universities within
            the state to the ongoing exploration of the periodic table's
            frontiers.

          Tennessine, with the symbol Ts and atomic number 117, is the
          second-heaviest element ever created. This synthetically produced
          element resides in the 7th period of the periodic table and boasts an
          impressive atomic mass. Despite its heavy stature, Tennessine exists
          only for a fleeting moment, with all known isotopes decaying within a
          fraction of a second. Its discovery holds significance as it
          potentially points towards the existence of an "island of stability"
          where superheavy elements might exhibit longer lifespans. Named after
          the US state of Tennessee, a center for transuranium element research,
          Tennessine stands as a testament to the ongoing exploration of the
          frontiers of the periodic table.

          In 2010, the scientific community witnessed a historic event - the
          announcement of Tennessine, element 117. This feat was achieved
          through a collaborative effort between Russian and American
          scientists, marking the most recent element discovery to date. The
          synthesis involved bombarding berkelium with calcium ions, resulting
          in the creation of a handful of tennessine atoms with incredibly short
          lifespans.

              The initial announcement was met with cautious optimism, as the
              fleeting nature of tennessine presented challenges in verifying
              its existence. However, in 2011, the successful creation of a
              daughter isotope of tennessine provided crucial confirmation,
              solidifying its place on the periodic table.

          Currently, Tennessine has no practical applications beyond scientific
          research. Due to its extreme rarity and short lifespan, it is
          impossible to produce or isolate it in meaningful quantities. However,

          of superheavy elements and contributes to our understanding of nuclear

          Tennessine doesn't exist naturally on Earth. It's solely produced in
